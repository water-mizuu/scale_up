Okay, I have managed to unify the navigation, and make it work with the session token thing.
However, whenever I register, there is this side effect where it is logged in (not sure if we ARE, but we are being redirected to home.)
I am pretty sure I have removed all references of this. Anyways, time to investigate tomorrow.

Also, I have to work on the search, databaseÂ (persistence), and the lesson page tomorrow. It's a long day.

I have managed to add some basic information in the lessons page, and when the tiles in the home
menu are clicked, the pages show up. Now, I have to do the following things next time:
- Parse the expression values into a evaluate-able objects
- Replace the `String`-typed units field in the lessons to refer to the complete units as
  specified in the document. It should have the shortcuts, display, name, and stuff.

I should also start on the data persistence side with firebase. Time to search later.

It's been two weeks. I have started work again on the project, and have linked the home page tiles
to the backend. There is basic persistence, but I have to work on the proper learning material later.
I have decided to split the quiz materials into two: "Learn" and "Practice".
- Learn should focus on the conversion themselves.
  - All direct units involved should be asked directly.
  - All indirect units should be quizzed to the users.

Before going to dinner, I have some ideas.
Instead of doing drag and drop, just click. LocalHeros should do the trick in animating.

LocalHeros didn't do anything right. That's stupid.

I have finished the main functionality of the application. All of the thought of quiz are
working as needed. Now, I have to focus on lesson content & other windows. I am thinking of
adding the global prompt based on the "Congrats" / "Oops" messages. This will be useful for
user confirmation and whatnot.

I have to do the following things:
  1. Integrate the sound I requested a while ago.
  2. Design a learn page

I have started to use some *ehem* tools for assisting with design. These are really good.
However, there are still some things I need to do.
  1. Implement the plain "continue" things in learn.
    - These are the questions which just describe the conversion and stuff.
    As such, there are things I need to do:
      1. Create a template for each (direct and direct)
      2. Create variations
      3. Designate the constrained shuffling.
  2. Indicate to the user the locked and stuff.

After some bugfixing, the application is close to completion. I have given up on parametrized conversions as it is outside the scope of the project.
